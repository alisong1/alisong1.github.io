            <h1>Alison's Final Project!</h1>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for my final project!
            </p>
            <h2> Initial Sketch </h2>
            <p>

            This is my initial sketch, it has a bill of materials, sketch, and circuit. This product will detect plant moisture and blink an LED when the plant needs to be watered. 
            <p>
            To build this project I will need: a soil moisture sensor, a 9v battery, a battery hookup, an arduino uno, a prototype shield, wires, a 330 ohm resistor, and a blue LED. I chose to use a 330 ohm resistor for the blue LED, despite technically being able to use a 100 ohm one, because it is too bright and messes with my phone camera. Calculation: (5-3.3 = 20(10^-3)*R, R=85)
