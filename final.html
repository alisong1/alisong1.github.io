            <h1>Alison's Final Project: Plant Moisture Sensor</h1>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for my final project!
            </p>
            <h2> Schematic </h2>
            <p>

            This is my initial sketch, it has a bill of materials, sketch, and schematic. This product is meant for people who are just getting into having houseplants. It can be rough sometimes to figure out when a plant needs to be watered, especially since every type has different requirements. This sensor is meant for any plant that is supposed to have consistently moist soil. It works by detecting the plant moisture, and if its getting too dry, it will blink an LED. I personally am having issues with root rot with a particular plant, so hopefully this will help.
            </p>
            <p>
            To build this project you will need: a soil moisture sensor, a 9v battery, a battery hookup, an arduino uno, a prototype shield, wires, a 330 ohm resistor, and a blue LED. I chose to use a 330 ohm resistor for the blue LED, despite technically being able to use a 100 ohm one, because it is too bright and messes with my phone camera. Calculation: (5-3.3 = 20(10^-3)*R, R=85) 
            </p>
            <h2> Code </h2>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            This is my code for the arduino. It works by taking an average value of the soil moisture over a short period of time, and if the moisture is low enough, it flashes an LED to tell the user to water their plant.

            This is a picture of my circuit! The first picture is of the circuit itself, and the second is of it in it's housing. 
            </p>
            <h2> Technical Writeup </h2>
            <p>
            In order to implement this product, you must do the following steps:
            1. Build the prototype using the arduino
            2. Program the ardunio and upload code.
            3. Build housing for and put circuit into housing. 
            </p>  
            <p>
            <b> Building the Prototype </b>
            </p> <p>
            In order to build the ardunio, you will need a soil moisture sensor, a 9v battery, a battery hookup, an arduino uno, a prototype shield, wires, a 330 ohm resistor, and a blue LED. 
            </p>
            <p>
            NOTE: It is a good idea to test your circuitry on a breadboard to verify it works before soldering. 
            </p>
            <p>
            First, place the shield on top of the arduino. Connect the moisture sensor to power and ground on the + and - pins, and to A0 on the s pin. Solder the negative (shorter) end of the LED to your resistor, and solder that resistor to a wire. Solder the end of the wire to ground on the shield. Then, solder the positive (longer) side of the LED to a wire, and put that wire in pin 9. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <b> Programming the arduino </b>
            </p> <p>
            Connect your arduino to your computer and upload the code provided. Verify that it works by connecting the battery and testing it on various soils. It should blink whenever the sensor is in dry soil.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b> Housing the circuit </b>
            </p> <p>
            Once your circuit is built and functioning, build a small box out of cardboard taking the measurements of your circuit into consideration. There are many templates and tutorials on the internet one can consult to do this. Cut two small holes in the top of the box for the sensor and LED to go through. Put the circuitry in the box and thread the LED and sensor through. Connect the battery and put sensor in plant and you're all set!

             And finally, here's a gif of my circuit's operation, and <a href = ""> here </a> is a link to my demo video. I couldn't have done this assignment without the help of Jasper in learning how to solder, code is partially copied from <a href = "https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/complete-guide-to-use-soil-moisture-sensor-w-examples-756b1f"> this </a> site.
