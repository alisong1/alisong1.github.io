            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2!

            <h2> Schematic </h2>

            This is my schematic! I chose to use a 10k ohm resistor for the button because that seems to be the standard for pushbuttons (according to the internet it preserves longevity of the button and reduces static). Next, I chose to use 330 ohm resistors for the RBG LED to be conservative as to not blow out the LED. For red I originally calculated 2V = .02 * R, where R = 100 ohms and green and blue 3.2V = .02 * R, R = 160 ohms, however, when I used 100 and 220 resistors (closest I had to 160), the LED was very bright and hard for my phone camera to pick up so I bumped all the resistors up to 330 ohm.

            <h2> Code </h2>

            <p>
            This is my code. It works by telling the button to wait for input, and when it gets input, it fades the RGB LED through a variety of colors before turning off.

            And finally, here's a gif of my circuit's operation. I couldn't have done this assignment without the help of TJ and Gina in class in figuring out how to use pushbottons and RGB LEDs, <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sik-experiment-guide-for-arduino---v32/experiment-3-driving-an-rgb-led">this</a> tutorial on wiring RBG LEDs, and <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Fading-RGB-LED-Arduino/">this</a> tutorial on fading an RBG LED, and <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/55895/how-to-turn-rgb-led-on-0dc2c5">this</a> tutorial on RGB LEDs and pushbuttons.
