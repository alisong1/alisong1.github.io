            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2!
            </p>
            <h2> Schematic </h2>

            This is my schematic! I chose to use 330 ohm resistors for the RBG LED to be conservative as to not blow out the LED. For red I originally calculated 2V = .02 * R, where R = 100 ohms and green and blue 3.2V = .02 * R, R = 160 ohms, however, when I used 100 and 220 resistors (closest I had to 160), the LED was very bright and hard to look at so I bumped all the resistors up to 300 ohm. 
            <p>

            <h2> Code </h2>

            </p>
            <p>
            This is my code. Each pin is connected to a different LED, and it works by separately telling each pin to turn on, wait for a second, and turn off. This creates the ordered blinking effect.

            <h2> Circuit </h2>

            This is a picture of my circuit!

            And finally, here's a gif of my circuit's operation. I couldn't have done this assignment without the help of TJ and Gina in class in figuring out how to create a circuit for a singular blinking LED, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iidi2wE8gok">this</a> youtube tutorial on creating multiple blinking LEDS, and <a href="http://www.techdose.com/electronics/Wiring-Multiple-LEDs/226/page3.html">this</a> schematic example.
